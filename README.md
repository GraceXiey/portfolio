Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve gained extensive experience working with cutting-edge tools and platforms, including Snowflake, GCP, and AWS. My most recent project involved building a chatbot powered by large language models (LLMs) to address healthcare patient inquiries for Northwestern Medicine, integrating natural language processing with real-world applications.

In addition, I’ve worked at Breakthru Beverage Group, where I developed a recommendation system using data mining techniques to create personalized product suggestions. My previous experience at UIUC's Rail Transportation and Engineering Center involved safety and risk analysis, which strengthened my ability to tackle complex problems with data-driven solutions.

I excel in data modeling, analysis, and strategy development, and I am passionate about transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights. My programming expertise, coupled with my experience working in collaborative environments, has prepared me to enhance efficiency and accuracy for businesses and communities alike.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am a multilingual communicator fluent in English, Chinese, Cantonese, Japanese, and Spanish, which helps me connect with diverse teams and clients. In my free time, I enjoy volleyball, badminton, photography, and video production.

I’m eager to connect with fellow data science professionals and enthusiasts to explore how we can harness the power of data and cloud platforms to solve real-world challenges and drive innovation. Let’s work together to create impactful solutions!
