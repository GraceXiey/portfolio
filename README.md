## Intro

I recently graduated with a Master’s degree from Northwestern University, where I honed my skills in data science and business analysis. My passion lies in leveraging data to uncover actionable insights and drive impactful decision-making.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve gained extensive experience working with cutting-edge tools and platforms, including Snowflake, GCP, and AWS. My most recent project involved building a chatbot powered by large language models (LLMs) to address healthcare patient inquiries for Northwestern Medicine, integrating natural language processing with real-world applications.

In addition, I’ve worked at Breakthru Beverage Group, where I developed a recommendation system using data mining techniques to create personalized product suggestions. My previous experience at UIUC's Rail Transportation and Engineering Center involved safety and risk analysis, which strengthened my ability to tackle complex problems with data-driven solutions.

I excel in data modeling, analysis, and strategy development, and I am passionate about transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights. My programming expertise, coupled with my experience working in collaborative environments, has prepared me to enhance efficiency and accuracy for businesses and communities alike.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am a multilingual communicator fluent in English, Chinese, Cantonese, Japanese, and Spanish, which helps me connect with diverse teams and clients. In my free time, I enjoy volleyball, badminton, photography, and video production.

I’m eager to connect with fellow data science professionals and enthusiasts to explore how we can harness the power of data and cloud platforms to solve real-world challenges and drive innovation. Let’s work together to create impactful solutions!


## Project Outline

#### Subscription Churn Rate Analysis 
This group project focused on developing business solutions for newspaper subscriptions, specifically analyzing factors influencing churn rates and strategies to enhance customer loyalty. Using R for exploratory data analysis and assumption testing, we examined the structural relationships of various attributes, refining the model by adding or excluding factors based on weighted results. We included our best prediction model and identified the key drivers of churn, such as post-trial frequency, and provided actionable marketing recommendations to improve retention.
